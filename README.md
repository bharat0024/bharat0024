👋 Hello there! I'm Makwana Bharat, currently pursuing a Master's Degree in Computer Applications (MCA) at Dharamshih Desai University 🎓, while also honing my skills as a developer at eSparkBiz Company.

🌳 My focus lies in TypeScript, NodeJS, and React, where I constantly seek to push boundaries and expand my expertise in these cutting-edge technologies.

🐾 Beyond academia, I'm enthusiastic about connecting with fellow professionals and forging meaningful relationships within our community.

🌊 As I look forward to 2024, my main goal is to immerse myself in collaborative development activities with my colleagues.

☕ With a profound love for tea, I indulge in exploring creative outlets like designing and drawing during my free time. Moreover, my passion for coding provides me with a sense of fulfillment and purpose.

Feel free to reach out to me on GitHub, and together, let's embark on a journey of professional growth and collaboration! 🚀
